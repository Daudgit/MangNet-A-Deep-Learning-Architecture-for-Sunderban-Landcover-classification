# MangNet: A Muti-Scale Contextual Information Driven Deep Learning Architecture designed to perform Sunderban Landcover classification

**Status:** Conference (Accepted)

## Motivation behind Building the MangNet Architecture
The motivation behind building the MangNet architecture stems from the increasing interest in automated classification of land-covers using machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly in the computer vision field. This application holds real-life significance as it enables the identification and categorization of different types of land-covers from satellite images.

Among various land-cover types, mangroves are of particular importance due to their unique ecosystem characteristics and their role in regulating climate in coastal areas. Mangroves also provide habitats for a diverse range of flora and fauna. Recognizing the significance of mangrove vegetation, this work focuses on designing a novel and computationally efficient deep learning architecture called MangNet.

MangNet is specifically designed to perform effective classification of diverse land-covers in the Sunderban region of West Bengal, India. The architecture leverages its multi-scale contextual feature extraction capability to extract relevant features from the satellite images. By considering the inter-relationship between nearby pixels within a patch, MangNet enables simultaneous classification of multiple pixels, thereby enhancing its performance efficiency.

Overall, the motivation behind building the MangNet architecture lies in the need for effective land-cover classification, particularly for mangrove ecosystems. By leveraging deep learning techniques and considering multi-scale contextual features, MangNet offers superior classification performance, contributing to the understanding and management of land-covers, specifically in the Sunderban region.

## Introduction
In the existing research conducted on the Sunderban area, the focus has primarily been on the identification of different mangrove species or the mapping of mangrove areas. However, it is important to note that besides mangroves, the Sunderban region is renowned for its diverse fauna, including iconic species such as the Royal Bengal Tiger and saltwater crocodiles, which are prominent aquatic predators. The changes in land-covers within this area significantly impact the lives of these creatures.

Recognizing the significance of considering a broader range of land-covers in the Sunderban area, this work introduces a novel deep learning network called MangNet. The purpose of MangNet is to enable efficient classification of various types of land-covers present in the selected Region of Interest (RoI). By capturing the changes in land-covers, this classification approach aims to provide valuable insights into the ecological dynamics of the area and the potential impacts on the diverse fauna inhabiting the region.

In this project, I have delved into a detailed discussion of the MangNet architecture, providing insights into its design and functioning. The results obtained through the implementation of MangNet are presented, along with comparative analyses to showcase its effectiveness in land-cover classification. By focusing on efficient land-cover classification using MangNet, this research work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the Sunderban region, considering the diverse ecosystems and wildlife it encompasses.

**Abstractâ€”** Automated classification of land-covers from satellite images using machine learning and deep learning approaches have garnered significant attention among researchers in the computer vision field in recent years due to the real-life significance of this application. Among various types of land covers mangroves stand out as a unique ecosystem that plays a crucial role in regulating the climate in coastal areas and providing a habitat for diverse flora and fauna. These characteristics make mangrove vegetation particularly significant. In this work, we present a novel and computationally efficient deep learning architecture called MangNet, designed to effectively classify diverse land covers in the Sunderban region of West Bengal, India. MangNet exploits its multi-scale contextual feature extraction capability to simultaneously classify multiple pixels within a patch, considering the inter-relationship between neighboring pixels, which enhances its performance efficiency. The designed architecture achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 99.64%, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. We have used freely accessible dual-polarized Sentinel-1 data from the chosen Region of Interest (RoI) to conduct this study and demonstrated the relevance of intensity and phase values in each polarized channel for classification in the Results section.
